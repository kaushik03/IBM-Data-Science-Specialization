----------------------------------------

This repo corresponds to `Kaushik Nagwekar's` course from **Coursera** for **IBM Data Science Specialisations**.
The subfolders reflects as seperate modules starting from scratch to advance level.


Presently there are two sub-folders:
- [x] What is Data Science?
- [x] Tools for Data Science
- [x] Data Science Methodologies
    - This course has one purpose, and that is to share a methodology that can be used within data science, to ensure that the data used in problem solving is relevant and properly manipulated to address the question at hand.
    - Accordingly, in this course,
        - The major steps involved in tackling a data science problem.
        - The major steps involved in practicing data science, from forming a concrete business or research problem, to collecting and analyzing data, to building a model, and understanding the feedback after model deployment.
         - How data scientists think!
- [x] Python for Data Science and AI
    - Python is one of the worldâ€™s most popular programming languages, and there has never been greater demand for professionals with the ability to apply Python fundamentals to drive business solutions across industries. 
    - This course is focused on fundamentals Including data structures and data analysis, complete hands-on exercises throughout the course modules, and create a final project to demonstrate your new skills. 
    
    **Final Project - Analysis US economy making Dashboard**
    - Tools used -
        1. Jupyter Notebook.
        2. IBM Watson Studio.

- [ ] Databases & SQL for Data Science.
- [ ] Data Analysis with Python
- [ ] Data Visualisation with Python.
- [ ] ML with Python
- [ ] Final Project.


> The first two topics : 
    1. What is Data Science and 
    2. Tools for Data Science 
are not included because, they are very basic foundational modules wherein `Rstudio` `Github` etc are explained.
