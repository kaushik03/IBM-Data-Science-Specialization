# About this module

Much of the world's data resides in databases. SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a powerful language which is used for communicating with and extracting data from databases. 

The purpose is to introduce relational database concepts and help learn and apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. 
It is also intended to get started with performing SQL access in a data science environment.  

The emphasis in this course is on hands-on and practical learning. 
- As such, 
    - To work with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. 
    - To create a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs you will practice building and running SQL queries.
    - To learn how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.
