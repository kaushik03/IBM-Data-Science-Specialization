To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n",

    "### Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:\n",
    "- Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    "- Matplotlib: Python Plotting Module.\n",
    "- Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "- Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n",
    "- JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n",
    "- XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n",
